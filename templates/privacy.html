        <h2 class="text-base font-semibold mb-1">What you paste</h2>
        <p>
          We do <span class="font-semibold">not</span> scrape any websites. You paste job descriptions,
          internship descriptions, and referral context into CareerAI. Those inputs are used only to run the
          tools you request (Job Pack, Internship Analyzer, Referral Trainer, etc.).

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-base font-semibold mb-1">Resume &amp; Profile Portal</h2>
        <p>
          Resume storage is <span class="font-semibold">optional</span> and can be deleted. Your Profile Portal
          and Resume Profile are used to power Skill Mapper, Portfolio Builder, Job Packs and other tools inside CareerAI.
          They are not shown publicly unless you explicitly enable a public portfolio page.

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-base font-semibold mb-1">Public portfolio pages</h2>
        <p>
          Public portfolio pages only render the content you configure plus minimal CareerAI branding.
          They do not expose dashboards, credit data, or internal analytics. You choose when to publish or unpublish.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-base font-semibold mb-1">University / tenant visibility</h2>
        <p>
          If you access CareerAI through your university portal, admins at your university may see aggregate usage
          analytics (for example, total runs of Skill Mapper or Job Packs). They do <span class="font-semibold">not</span>
          see your private tool inputs or AI outputs, unless your institution has a separate agreement that clearly states otherwise.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-base font-semibold mb-1">Billing &amp; payments</h2>
        <p>
          Payments are handled entirely by Stripe. CareerAI does not store or process your card details. We only retain
          minimal billing metadata (for example, that your account is on Pro) so that features like Gold ⭐ credits work correctly.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-base font-semibold mb-1">Deleting your data</h2>
        <p>
          You can request deletion of your account data via support or your university administrator. We will remove
          your Profile Portal, Resume Profile, and any stored AI outputs associated with your account, subject to
          legal and compliance requirements.

      This is a high-level summary. If your university or institution has a separate data-processing agreement with CareerAI,
      that document will take priority where there is any conflict.
